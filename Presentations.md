## Presentations (talks/posters)

As well as presenting my work with collaborators' groups I often present at international conferences, and for invited seminars. Please feel free to contact me if you would like me to give a seminar in your department!

A full list of my talks can be found in my [CV](/Barratt_CV_full.pdf)
