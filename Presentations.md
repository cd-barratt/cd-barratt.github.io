## Presentations (talks/posters)

As well as presenting my work in my own institutes and collaborators' groups I often present at international conferences, and for invited seminars. I've given talks at international conferences and other invited talks around the world. Please feel free to contact me if you would like me to give a seminar!

A full list of my talks (and posters) can be found in my [CV](/Barratt_CV_full.pdf)
