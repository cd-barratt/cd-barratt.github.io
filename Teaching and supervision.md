## Teaching

### Formal teaching
* Guest Lecturer for MSc in Macroecology, Macroevolution and Global change at the University of Leipzig (includes 2 lectures, designing and leading a 1 day practical course, supervising MSc project work and assessing exams). (2020-)
* Teaching Assistant for BSc level Biology - ~200 hours over 2.5 years at the University of Salford (2010-2012)

### Workshops
* Designed and led several 1-2 day workshops at the University of Basel and iDiv, mainly based on understanding how to process and interpret genomic data (e.g. data processing, population structure, genetic diversity, demopgraphic history) and species distribution modelling. (2015-)

### Biodiversity data collection techniques and field biology
Field instructor for ecological data collection (amphibians, birds, butterflies, small mammals, carnivores and large mammal tracking) - Frontier Tanzania Savannah Research Project (2008-2009)


### Supervision
I have mentored and supervised several undergraduate and postgraduate students at many academic levels (BTEC, BSc, MSc). For details please see my full [CV](/Barratt_CV_full.pdf)

I currently co-supervise the genomic and/or species distribution modelling work of four students at iDiv:
