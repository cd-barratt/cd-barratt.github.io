# Teaching

## Workshops
* Designed and led several 1-2 day workshops at the University of Basel and iDiv, mainly based on understanding how to process and interpret genomic data (e.g. data processing, population structure, genetic diversity, demopgraphic history) and species distribution modelling. (2015-)

## Formal teaching
* Guest Lecturer for MSc in Macroecology, Macroevolution and Global change at the University of Leipzig (includes 2 lectures, designing and leading a 1 day practical course, supervising MSc project work and assessing exams). (2020-)
 
* Teaching Assistant for BSc level Biology - ~200 hours over 2.5 years at the University of Salford (2010-2012)


## Supervision
I am very happy to co-supervise the genomic and/or species distribution modelling work of several wonderful students affiliated with iDiv:
* Marilia Souza Lucas (2021-)
* Francisco Velasquez Puentes (2019-)
* Jeprianto Manurung (2019-)
