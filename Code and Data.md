## Code and Data
I believe in open source tool development and data availability so you can find most of my relevant code and datasets on my [GitHub](https://github.com/cd-barratt) account (with links to relevant data repositories for my published work).

If you want paper-specific datasets and code please see the relevant data accessibility links in my published papers - I almost always provide everything as part of the publications. If there's something missing, feel free to ask me!
