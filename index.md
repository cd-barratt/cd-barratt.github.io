### Research Line
My research aim is to categorise and understand biodiversity patterns and the underlying eco-evolutionary mechanisms that shape them, to provide insights and tools that assist biodiversity management in our rapidly changing world. I i) investigate patterns and mechanisms shaping diversity in changing environments (past, present and future) across individuals, populations and species, and ii) develop cutting edge bio- and eco-informatic tools for automating complex analyses with practical applications for biodiversity monitoring and management. My areas of expertise are in population genomics, bioinformatics, and ecoinformatics. I have a special focus on African and European vertebrates in my research but I also work with other taxonomic groups (e.g. plants, invertebrates, fungi) in different geographical areas (e.g. Madagascar, Asia, South America).

### Academic history post-PhD

In 2017 received my PhD 'Biodiversity patterns and conservation of the Coastal Forests of Eastern Africa biodiversity hotspot' from the University of Basel, Switzerland. This work was funded through the by a competitive grant from the [Humer Foundation for Academic Talent](https://www.humerstiftung.ch/index-en.html) with the support of the [Centre for African Studies Basel](https://zasb.unibas.ch/en/research/). After my PhD I moved to Germany where I obtained funding for two postdoc grants (6 years total). From August 2018 until March 2021 I was awarded an [iDiv](https://www.idiv.de/) Flexpool grant for a project to measure habitat connectivity of chimpanzees over the last 120,000 years and quantify their historical demography using genomic data. in 2021 I obtained an [synthesis grant](https://www.idiv.de/research/sdiv/) to quantify multi-species population vulnerability to global change by integrating molecular, ecological and environmental data. This work was continued in a short postdoc position at [Naturalis Biodiversity Center](https://www.naturalis.nl/en) in Leiden, Netherlands.

Since September 2024 I've been employed as a researcher at the [Centre for Genetic Resources](https://www.wur.nl/en/research-results/statutory-research-tasks/centre-for-genetic-resources-the-netherlands.htm), within the [Animal Breeding and Genomics](https://www.wur.nl/nl/onderzoek-resultaten/leerstoelgroepen/dierwetenschappen/animal-breeding-and-genomics-group.htm) group in Wageningen (Netherlands). Here I am responsible for several projects based on genomics and genetic diversity monitoring as well as eDNA community level biodiversity assessments.
