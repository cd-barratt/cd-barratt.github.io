I am interested in elaborating upon spatial patterns of biodiversity by understanding the ecological and evolutionary processes which may contribute to them.  I am fascinated by natural history and ecology, and seek to understand how we can better conserve biodiversity using a combination of molecular data and biogeographical approaches. My areas of expertise are in population genetics, phylogenetics, next generation sequencing and bioinformatics, and ecoinformatics for spatial and environmental data. I have mostly focused on African and European vertebrates in my research so far but I also work with other taxonomic groups in different geographical areas when I can.

I am currently a postdoc at iDiv (German Centre for Integrative Biodiversity Research) with an sDiv individual grant for a project to quantify population vulnerability to global change using molecular, ecological and environmental data together.

From 2017 to 2020 I had a Flexpool grant to work on a project to measure habitat connectivity of chimpanzees over the last 120,000 years and quantify their historical demography using genomic data here at iDiv and the Max Planck Institute (Department of Primatology) in Leipzig.

I gained my PhD in 2017 under the supervision of Simon Loader (NHM London) based in the Biogeography department and Centre for African Studies Basel at the University of Basel, Switzerland, funded by the Humer Foundation for Academic Talent.
